# Project-Paddy-Field
This Unciv extension mod adds in the Wet Farm. Unlike with Palengke and Project Lantaka, all you need here is vanilla Unciv and this works with any mod. The Wet Farm originally came from Nirekin-sys's Tondo mod and I decided to make an extension mod based off from that because paddy farms are quite widespread internationally.

v.1.1: Updated the Wet Farm's tileset.
